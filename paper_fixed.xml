                        <text type="guide">Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.</text>Probably the hardest part of setting goals is the first step of actually deciding to take action! The first barrier facing most people is the incorrect assumption that goals are only for business people. The reality is everyone sets goals mentally throughout the day. There are always occasions where something has to be done at a particular time or in a particular place. Simple examples could be getting up at a certain time in order to be at work, or to meet with a friend for a leisure activity. The beauty of having goals is the uniqueness of each one to the goal setter. Whether it is personal, financial, business or spiritual, they are all specific to that person and their circumstances. The most important part initially is to write them down. Having goals written down gives you incredible power while helping you to focus on this area. Aim for something that will stretch you while remaining achievable. If you achieve your goal too easily, it is not high enough to make any significant change in your life and needs to be adjusted. On the other hand, if you consistently miss the goals, you will only get discouraged and probably give up. The aim is to keep growing, and moving into a more satisfactory position for your particular circumstances. As you obtain the levels that you have set for yourself, always include a small reward at each point. This might only be a small thing in the early days like a meal out or a weekend vacation. Remember that these changes will not happen overnight and there will be a period of time when nothing seems to be happening. This is why the goals need to be detailed and as specific as possible with a consequence and benefit. Allow some time on a daily basis to educate yourself on how to make the necessary adjustments in your life. This could include listening to a CD, or reading a book on motivation, etc. A simple method to start with could be one goal in the main areas of life to be achieved in one month, six months, twelve months or five years. Break that down further into a daily, weekly and monthly system. Stay focused and disciplined to achieve all that you desire.

                        <text>Although American mythology says that the Civil War was fought to free the slaves, historians agree that the political struggle that unfolded between the North and the South was primarily a contest between a southern plantation elite and northern industrial, mercantile, and agrarian interests. It was political pressure and the necessities of war that led Lincoln to announce the Emancipation Proclamation in September 1862. But the proclamation did not in fact end slavery: it did not apply to areas under Union control — border slave states and Confederate areas occupied by northern armies. Critics pointed out the proclamation freed slaves only in those areas where they could not be reached. Even so, the proclamation served notice on the South that the war had become a social revolution; if the Confederacy were defeated, the slave-based society of the South would also fall. When the war was over in 1865, the future of the former slaves was uncertain. The nation, still divided in spirit, plunged into a decade of political and social turmoil (混乱). In shaping their Reconstruction policies, the Radical Republicans were in part motivated by the abolitionist argument that a legalized caste (阶级) system was not compatible with American institutions. But they were also concerned that the southern states should not reenter the Union with the old planter elite still in control. It was the North&apos;s lack of commitment to the black&apos;s rights that ultimately doomed Reconstruction; in 1877, when the last occupation forces were withdrawn from the South, the region was on its own again. However, Jim Crow — legalized segregation — did not follow at once. It was during the 1890s and early 1900s that Jim Crow laws legalizing segregation were passed throughout the South. Before this time, blacks still voted in substantial numbers and received equal treatment on common carriers, trains, and streetcars. But blacks and whites attended separate schools, and whites did not accept blacks as social equals.</text>
